        131 teams. 12 weeks of action. All fighting to be the best. This is NCAA Football. 
        <br>
        In this game, you will sim a season at a time as the head coach (very basic) of any of the 131 teams. 
        <br>
        Which team you choose is up to you. 
        <br>
        You will be assigned 12 games to fill out your "season". 
        <br>
        <b><b>Note: The postseason simulation is not working right now. It will be implemented in the future.</b></b>
        <br>
        <b>6 wins gets you a bowl</b>
        <br>
        <b>10 wins gets you a playoff berth (top 4)</b>
        <br>
        Disclaimer: Due to CPU limitations, simultaneous simulations cannot be run, so ranking will not be implemented for now.
